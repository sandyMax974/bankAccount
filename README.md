# Bank Account (Java)

Your task is to write an application that a user can call to make bank transactions and then print a bank statement to the terminal.

## Requirements
* Implement deposits and withdrawals
* Implement an account statement that prints a heading row, and the date, amount and balance of each transaction, most recent first.
* You don't need to implement a command-line or user interface, test-driving and calling it in your main method.
* Data can be kept in memory, doesn't need to be in a database.

Output:
```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2021 || - || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2021 || 2000.00 || - || 3000.00
10/01/2021 || 1000.00 || - || 1000.00
```
